    <h4><u>What is it?</u></h4>

    <p> 
       Much like regular Skis where you push and slide with your legs, Roller Skis are ment to be used on dry surfaces, instead of snow. Roller Skis simulate the same effect as normal Skis, and even use the same Ski boots. 
    <p/>

    <h4><u>Why is this a thing?</u></h4>

    <p> 
       Many olmypic competetions require Skis, such as: Freestyle Skiing, Biathlon, Cross-Country Skiing and a couple others. Many athletes who participate in these competion are requried to practise year round, even when its summer, how do you think they do that? <br/>
       They use the power of Roller Skis! There's even a saying in scandavian countires, that Skiing is a summer sport for in winter you should be competing and in the summer you should be practising. 
       <br/><br/>
       Here are two super cool videos that show you the awesomeness of Roller Skiing and the history of Roller Skiing!

    <h4><u>Types of Roller Skis</u></h4>
    
    <p>
       Just like regular Skiing there are a couple diffrent styles:
    </p>
    
    <!--This info is on Classical Skis-->
    <p>
       <u>Classical Style:</u> 
       With this style the Skis are always parallel to the driver and so are the sticks. The right arm and the left foot are sychnorized with each other, and so is the left arm and the right foot. On classical style roller Skies the wheels are thicker than skate style, as it helps with balance. 
    </P>

    <!--This info is on Skate Style SKiies -->
    <p>
       <u>Skate Style:</u>
       With this style the Skis operate much like using regular skates, this method can be faster, where the right foot and right arm are sychnorized, vise versa. On skate style roller Skis the wheels are thinner, as less width is needed to maintain balance.
